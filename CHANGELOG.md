- May create issue with slug-routing

- If you are not using SvelteKit -> please continue using `IonTabsLegacy.svelte`
- See - https://github.com/Tommertom/ionic-svelte-tabs-howto
- Important notes when migrating away from legacy:
  - Change your icon reference and include imports `import {close} from 'ionicons/icons';`
  - Complete the `+layout.svelte` as per howto
  - Create the subfolders for the routes

  - Make sure they are wrapped in `ion-tab` with `tab` property

## 0.5.34

- Capacitor added to creator 0.0.8
- Ionicons bug fix in creator - disabled verbose logging for the time being

## 0.5.30

- Changed the default starter to use the cjs import, also to enable codesplitting - creator 0.0.8
- `setupIonicSvelte()` deprecated - Changed config routine to `setupIonicBase();`

```
<script lang="ts">
	import { setupIonicSvelte } from 'ionic-svelte';

	/* Theme variables */
	import '../theme/variables.css';

	/* Call Ionic's setup routine */
	setupIonicSvelte();

</script>

<ion-app>
	<slot />
</ion-app>

```

Should become:

```
<script lang="ts">
	import { setupIonicBase } from 'ionic-svelte';

	/* Call Ionic's setup routine */
	setupIonicBase();

	/* Import all components - or do partial loading - see below */
	import 'ionic-svelte/components/all';

	/* Theme variables */
	import '../theme/variables.css';

	/*
		This part - import 'ionic-svelte/components/all'; -  loads all components at once.

		This adds at least >800kb (uncompressed) to your bundle.

		You can also choose to import each component you want to use separately. Example:

        	import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-app';
                import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-card';
                import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-card-title';
                import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-card-subtitle';
                import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-card-header';
                import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-card-content';
                import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-chip';
                import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-button';

		It is recommended to do this in this file, as you only need to do such once. But you are free
		to do this elsewhere if you like to code-split differently.

		You can find these import lines to copy here by going to the imported file below (ionic-svelte/components/all).

		Please don't forget to import ion-app in this file when you decide to code-split:

	    import 'ionic-svelte/components/ion-app';
	*/

</script>

<ion-app>
	<slot />
</ion-app>


```

## 0.5.29

- Updated typings
- Modular imports available, but not defaulted yet

## 0.5.28/27

- Typings for style, default events, class added
- Still problem with ok-text (ion-select), is-open (modal) etc...
- How to deal with svelte specific goodies like use: and bind:....?
- Also padding (with =true), checked (without parameter)
- Fixed issue create-app script (now 0.0.7) - Package warnings are treated as errors

## 0.5.26

- Ionic event type bindings fix

## 0.5.25

- Fixes in type definitions (slots)

## 0.5.24

- Removed Experimental package - no ES-imports because of style encapsulation
- Added typings (need a bit more testing)

## 0.5.22

- Added create-ionic-svelte-app package

## 0.5.21

- Fixed issue with generation of slots - experimental is working again

## 0.5.20

- Package.json main added - so working with new Kit
- Experimental package is BROKEN

## 0.5.19

- FAIL warning when working with newer SvelteKit versions...

## 0.5.18

- multiple fixes on generate script (slots missing in ion-buttons - source code does not have slots)
- comments added for manual post processing
- removed warning in IonMenu.svelte

## 0.5.17

- added typing in IonTabs
- fixed issue icon in IonItem
- ion-menu warning added
- slot support introduced! (experimental still) - solution found in one of the references in https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/1689 (ui5 example), but had to tweak it a bit (using $$props, not $$restprops)

## 0.5.16

- fixed issue with not globally replacing tags
- added warning that type conversion is not done (like, translucent="true" will not be converted into translucent={true})

## 0.5.13

- Regenerated all experimental components as they had on:click twice - leading to triggering the event twice
- Support for bind:value bindings by redispatching and using ionChange events, making property binding finally possible

## 0.5.11

- minor updates to experimental components
- added migration script to migrate from kebab-case components to pascal-case - `migrateToImport.js` which you can run using `node migrateToImport <directoryname>`

## 0.5.10

- starting with changelog
- added generator scripts to generate svelte wrappers from Core Stencil code on github
- added "experimental" components - in order to move from kebab-case/webcomponent usage to tree-shakeable and type-safe Pascalcase. So moving from `<ion-button>A great button</ion-button>` to

```
import { IonButton } from 'ionic-svelte/experimental/components/IonButton.svelte';
<IonButton>A great button</IonButton>
```

Experimental also has version of `setupIonicSvelte`.

So if you want to use this, change imports from ` ... from 'ionic-svelte` to ` ... from 'ionic-svelte/experimental`
